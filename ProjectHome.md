Spinaweb is a Web Application for Propeller Spin development.

Spinaweb only works with Chrome, Firefox, or Safari web browsers. Internet Explorer is not supported.

Spinaweb requires a server running on the host PC or other device which responds to AJAX requests. A sample server is included and can be run with python.

Python2.7 and pyserial2.7 are required at the moment. An executable can be created for windows users with "python py2exesetup.py py2exe".


To run spinaweb from a Windows PC:

  1. Start the python server by clicking start.bat
  1. Enter http://localhost:8080 in your web browser address.
  1. Click CMD tool X to close/kill the server when you are done.


To run spinaweb from Linux or Mac:

  1. Start the python server by entering $ python webtool.py
  1. Enter http://localhost:8080 in your web browser address.
  1. Kill the server with Ctrl+C. Ctrl+Z then kill %1 may be required.
